 5. Solution Consideration:
    - Use the `consider_solutions` tool to generate potential solutions based on the comprehensive analysis.

 6. Risk Assessment:
    - Apply the `risk_assessment` tool to evaluate potential risks associated with the proposed solutions.

 7. Web Research:
    - If additional information is needed, use the `review_web_page` tool to analyze relevant web content.

 8. Synthesis and Recommendation:
    - Synthesize the insights gained from all previous steps.
    - Provide a well-reasoned recommendation that addresses the problem comprehensively, considers future scenarios, a
 mitigates potential risks.
