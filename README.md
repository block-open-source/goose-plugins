## Installation

Goose plugins are currently only available by cloning this repository and linking to your local version of Goose. Installation via a package manager is being investigated. Keep an eye out for updates!

These instructions assume have cloned the Goose repository and the Goose plugins repository and are able to run goose running via `uv run goose`.

1. List the current toolkits available

```sh
uv run goose toolkit list
```

2. Install the goose community plugins in editable mode

```sh
uv add --editable ~/path/to/goose-plugins
```

3. List the toolkits again to see the new plugins

```sh
uv run goose toolkit list
```

You should see the community plugins in the list of available toolkits.

4. Add the plugin to your Goose configuration file

Update your config at `~/.config/goose/profile.yaml` to include the plugin you want to use.

```yaml
default:
  provider: anthropic
  processor: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  accelerator: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  moderator: truncate
  toolkits:
    - name: developer
      requires: {}
    - name: your_community_plugin
      requires: {}
```

5. Start a new goose session and your plugin should be available.

```sh
uv run goose session start
```
